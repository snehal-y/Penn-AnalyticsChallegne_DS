Challenge:
Recommend a course of action regarding the mystery spin experiment. Should we implement Variant 1, Variant 2, revert to the control, or wait longer?

Objective: Find which variant is impactful to gain more revenue. Check if revenue is gained when the player visits the Buy Page of Mystery Spin game. This means either we need to find what all factors make players to purchase during their experiment or what are the factors which are making more views on the Buy Page.

Target (Dependent variable) => bc (if player has made a purchase or not)


Analysis:
1. I would prefer either Variant 0 or Variant 1. Because with Variant0 or Variant 2, the player should make number of spins greater than 73068 but less than 110351, then only player will possibly make purchase. With 91% confidence, 78 players out of 79 players will possibly make a purchase during their experiment.
2. A player will most likely (73%) make a purchase if he/she visits the Buy Page for 5 to 7 times in a week from the day the player has entered the experiment. This is possible only if the player makes number of spins more than 8,946.
3. Irrespective of the type of the Variant, a player will most likely make a purchase during the experiment if the player finds something engaging in the game. In this case, number of spins followed by heartbeats seemed to be engaging factors for any player.



Recommendations:
1. Engaging factors such as Spins and heartbeats are required to acquire new and sustain existing players.
2. Additional engaging features would be beneficial.
3. Rewarding existing players would be beneficial to keep them engaged and attracted towards the game.
